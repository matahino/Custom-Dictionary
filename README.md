Back when I was still young, I found myself in a small facility. <br>
There, we had computers without Wi-Fi and couldn't even change environment variables.<br>
Of course, such an environment wasn't conducive to learning. <br>
So, I created a dictionary with just the defaults. <br>
"Learn from this," I'd say to my past self. <br>
Currently, this application lacks dictionary functionality as it doesn't implement features like Linq, making it impossible to add or customize.<br>

The csc command can be used to create an executable file as is.<br><br>
In addition, this time, the panel is placed to add functionality to columns and rows, which is reproduced by dividing the panel into sections.
